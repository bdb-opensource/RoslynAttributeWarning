# RoslynAttributeWarning
This project will allow you to create custom attributes with warning

Internally there is a file called IDEMessageAttribute which is used for the example,
extract that to a seperate dll, and install the vsix Extension and it will provide a 
new analzer for your project to throw warnings.
